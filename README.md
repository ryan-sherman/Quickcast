# Quickcast

Quickcast is an open source Android application for viewing e-sports scores being developed by a team of Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS) students.

Our current goal is to reach functionality for DOTA 2 while keeping our server and app system flexible enough to add other sports in the future.

*Resources and technologies we are working with include:*

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Json
- Android Studio

Known Bugs:
Gradle does not build properly in some versions.  If volley appears to be empty or does not exist, clone the volley for android repository in the frontend directory and rebuild.  You may also need to install Android v. 22 through tools>sdk manager if build still fails.
